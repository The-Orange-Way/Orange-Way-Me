/**
 * "Sync all connections": what to send, and what to say about what came back.
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS THIS REPLACES, both of the same family.
 *
 * 1. Every connection id was sent to `or-sync`, including private ones.
 *    `or-sync` selects from the `connections` table. A private connection is
 *    not in it, it is in a separate store scoped by app user. So the id
 *    matched nothing and the function honestly returned no entry for it.
 *
 * 2. The caller then read only `res.synced` and the entries that carried an
 *    `error`. A requested id that came back as neither is invisible to both
 *    tests, so a user whose only connection is private pressed "Sync all" and
 *    was told "no new transactions across any wallet". Nothing had been
 *    attempted. That sentence is the failure, not the reporting of it.
 *
 * The same absent-id guard shipped for the single-connection Sync in DL-1051.
 * This is that guard, applied to the plural path, plus the routing fix that
 * stops asking a function about rows it cannot see.
 *
 * WHY PRIVATE CONNECTIONS ARE NEVER SYNCED IN BULK. Scanning one needs the OR
 * widget open in this browser, one popup per connection, started by a user
 * gesture. A loop of popups is blocked by browsers and would break the
 * user-initiated rule the single-connection path was reviewed against. So bulk
 * sync excludes them and says so out loud, rather than including them and
 * reporting nothing.
 *
 * Pure and exported so both halves can be tested. The originals were inline in
 * a click handler with no test, which is exactly how a sentence that means
 * "we did nothing" got shipped as "you are up to date".
