/**
 * What to say after the OR connect widget reports success.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES. A user pastes an extended public key they have
 * already added. Orange Rails is right to deduplicate: the same key is the same
 * wallet, so `or-stealth-connection-create` answers
 *
 *     200 {"connection_id":"<the existing one>","already_existed":true}
 *
 * The widget then closes and posts back only
 *
 *     {"type":"or-link-success","connection_id":"<the existing one>","source_wallets":[]}
 *
 * `already_existed` is dropped on the way. The app therefore renders nothing: no
 * toast, no new row, no explanation. Observed end to end on the deployed dev
 * site, where the connections list was byte identical before and after. Every
 * report of "I added a wallet and nothing happened" is this.
 *
 * Note what is NOT the fix: waiting for Orange Rails to forward the flag. That
 * change is worth making and is filed separately, but this app does not need it.
 * The app already knows which connections it was showing a moment ago, so it can
 * tell "this is new" from "you already had this" on its own, and a fix that
 * depends on nobody else shipping is the one that reaches the user.
 *
 * Pure and exported so both branches are testable. The old behaviour was an
 * unexamined `await refresh()` in a click handler, which is how silence became
 * the product's answer to a successful action.
