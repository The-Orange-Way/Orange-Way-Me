/**
 * Which routes analytics is allowed to run on.

 * Orange Way ships the marketing site and the authenticated app from one
 * SPA, so "marketing-site analytics" is a claim about routes, not about
 * hostnames. This module is the only place that claim is encoded.
 *
 * Default deny: a path is non-marketing unless it is listed here. Adding a
 * new app screen therefore requires no analytics change, and forgetting to
 * update this file makes the new screen silent rather than tracked.
