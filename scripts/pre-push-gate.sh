#   1. /pr-this marker (`.git/.pr-this-ran`) is newer than HEAD on the branch

#   2. The repo's pre-publish leak scanner (`scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh`)
#      reports clean.
#   3. No private-host / private-wiki URL leaks in the commits being pushed
#      (commit messages + diff).
#   4. No secret-shaped strings in the diff that gitleaks would catch.

# the very first commit) -- callers scan from the root in that case instead of
# excluding a base. Both the reserved-term scan and the gitleaks scan use this
# so they cannot drift on what "the base" means.

#   1. The remote ref's current tip (from pre-push stdin), when the remote
#      already has this branch. That is the precise base of an incremental
#      push; using the mainline merge-base instead would re-scan the branch's
#      own earlier commits and could re-trip on a finding already pushed there.
#   2. The merge-base with origin/dev, then origin/main, for a new remote ref.
#   3. Nothing (orphan / initial commit): no shared history to subtract.
