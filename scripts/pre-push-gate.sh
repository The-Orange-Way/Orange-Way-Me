#
# What it checks (refuses the push if any FAIL):
#   1. /pr-this marker (`.git/.pr-this-ran`) is newer than HEAD on the branch
#      being pushed. If absent or stale, the push is refused.
#   2. The repo's pre-publish leak scanner (`scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh`)
#      reports clean.
#   3. No private-host / private-wiki URL leaks in the commits being pushed
#      (commit messages + diff).
#   4. No secret-shaped strings in the diff that gitleaks would catch.
#
# Override (escape hatch — emits a loud warning, do not use casually):
#   PR_THIS_BYPASS=1 git push
#
# Install on a fresh clone:
