#   1. /pr-this marker (`.git/.pr-this-ran`) is newer than HEAD on the branch

#   2. The repo's pre-publish leak scanner (`scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh`)
#      reports clean.
#   3. No private-host / private-wiki URL leaks in the commits being pushed
#      (commit messages + diff).
#   4. No secret-shaped strings in the diff that gitleaks would catch.
