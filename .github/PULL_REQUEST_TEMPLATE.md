## Summary

<!-- One sentence: what this PR does, in plain language. -->

## Why

<!-- 2-4 bullets: the problem and why it matters now. Link issues if any. -->

## What changed

<!-- A short list of the concrete edits, grouped by file or area. Not a diff — a reader's-digest version. -->

## What I considered and rejected

<!-- 1-3 bullets. Each one: the alternative, and why you didn't pick it. If you didn't consider alternatives, say so. -->

## Risks and trade-offs

<!-- Be honest. "This adds a DB round-trip per request" is useful. "No risks" is almost never true and is a red flag to reviewers. -->

## Zero-knowledge check

<!-- Does this change let the server read anything it previously could not? If yes, justify. If no, confirm. -->

## How to verify

<!-- The exact commands a reviewer should run, or the manual steps to click through. If you ran tests, paste the summary line (e.g. "12 tests pass, 0 fail"). -->

## Out of scope

<!-- What you deliberately did not touch, so the reviewer knows not to ask for it here. -->

## Pre-publish checklist

<!--
Required for every PR. The leak-check workflow runs `scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh`
as a CI gate. Run it locally first to skip the CI round-trip:

  bash scripts/pre-publish-scan.sh
